## Introduction

Briefly describe the purpose of your repository.  What kind of algorithms are included? What is the intended audience?  For example:

> This repository aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of various machine learning algorithms. It includes both the mathematical derivations behind the algorithms and practical code examples in Python.  This resource is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to deepen their knowledge of ML algorithms and learn how to implement them.

## Algorithms

This section is the core of your README.  Organize it by algorithm.

### Algorithm 1 Name (e.g., Linear Regression)

#### Derivation

Provide a link to the PDF or Markdown file containing the mathematical derivation.  If the derivation is short and self-contained, you could include it directly here using MathJax (for LaTeX rendering).

```markdown
[Mathematical Derivation](path/to/linear_regression_derivation.pdf)  or [Derivation](linear_regression_derivation.md)

Or, if short:

$$
\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$
